# Sentiment Detection using CNN
This is a simple sentiment detector using your primary video recording device such that a CNN is trained on affectnet dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noamsegal/affectnet-training-data). The model is trained and then for each frame captured by the recording device, a sentiment is display on the window simultaneously.

Steps to run:
1. Download the affectnet dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noamsegal/affectnet-training-data).
2. Create a folder affectnet and move the sentiment folders into the newly created folder.
3. Run train.py to train on affectnet
4. Run main.py to commence predicting
